Since, Google's Knowledge Graph intro 2012, Knowledge Graph was 
Nowaday, attention mechanism is one of the state-of-the-art methods using in deep learning not only in natural language processing but also using in computer vision.
It's demonstrate to replacement any convolution operator \cite{cordonnier2020multi}. Attetion mechanism also apply into Knowledge Graph via \cite{velivckovic2017graph}, 
Many interesting improvement has been apply to attention mechanism, but
